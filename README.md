ABAP Examples
=============

_To view examples goto the wiki. Corresponding code is kept here._

As a programmer, and one who works with many languages, I've made extensive use of Google and other internet search engines. The internet serves as a great reference guide for problems which I forget minor details to looking up things which I've never even seen before.

One thing that a programming language can really benefit from is good documentation. Documentation can illustrate to developers what is avaliable to them to solve any issues they come up across. Good documentation even helps give insight to issues less tackled.

And then theres this guy called `ABAP`, a programming language developed for the ERP solution SAP. What I find amazing about this language is how little _good_ documentation there actually is. _Take it with a grain of salt please, I don't mean every single person is guilty of it on these sites_.

* http://help.sap.com/ is really good at providing a ton of the information an ABAP developer will never actually need.
* http://scn.sap.com/community/abap is really good at providing information on god knows what. There are _so_ many links, resources, blogs, files, and posts that I don't even know where to begin looking. The search function, _if_ it works, doesn't provide me with any useful information either.
* I'll name examples later. 

## Seperate The Business & Technical Details

The general concensus amoung `ABAP` developers as to what the language actually needs reveals shocking details: _"We want more business in ABAP"_, _"But the nature of ABAP is business, not technical."_

**Wrong**. The nature of `ABAP` is a progamming language. Just like `C`, `C++`, `C#`, `PHP`, `Java`, `Javascript`, `Basic`, or whatever language, `ABAP` has classes, interfaces, methods, variables, and arithmetic. `ABAP` supports math and logic _which we as developers take advantage of to encapsulate the notion of a physical reality within a **computer program**_. The nature of your individual responsibilities for customers is business. 

Consider also the two elements which combine to form a computer program. **Programs** are verbs, actions while **Data** is a noun, an object. **Programs** are like people while **Data** are the objects people interact with. If people are removed from the equation than the objects they interact no longer have meaning. If a person is interacting with a car, but that person has never seen a car before she'd/he'd have no idea what to do with it, thus it carries no meaning. In the sense of an ABAP program _You are the program and the data your program processes, for example material data, are the objects. If the program wasn't there, the data would mean **nothing**_. 

## Clean, Simple, Technical Examples

This is more or less something personal for me. I often forget the details of things like ALV lists and I find myself frequently using Google to fetch the same details from the same bloated examples. I'd also hope for this to be a resource not only for myself but others.
