Don't Do This
=============

This folder is intended to be an example of things you shouldn't do in SAP and why you shouldn't do it. Each report is meant as a seperate lesson to teach the rest of the world why quality actually matters.

Don't take it personal if you see something you've done here. Use it to learn a lesson to improve your skills as a consultant and programmer.
